## About Open Scrum

Open Scrum is a agile project managment web application with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

Create and manage projects with plan and work views
Group issues in a project into sprints
Set deadlines for issues, active sprints and projects
Get reminders via email listing issues nearing deadline
Responsive UI, thanks to Bootstrap
